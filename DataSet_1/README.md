# DataMining
Faisal and I will use this repository for our Data Mining project

Our original five questions:
-What kind of new vehicles are being bought by consumers? 
-What can be some reasons that types of vehicles are being bought as compared to other niche types? 
-What is the current market for the following vehicle types: sedans, trucks, SUVs, compacts, hybrids?
-What demographics are interested in what kind of car: this can include age, location, income, etc?
